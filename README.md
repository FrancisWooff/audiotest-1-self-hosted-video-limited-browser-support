Template for University of Salford MSc Audio Production students to adapt to host comparative audio tests online

To use this template the following additional actions are required as a minimum:
1. A video file with multiple audio tracks to switch between should accompany the other files (html, css, js & php) in the directory. The video file referenced in the html files currently is “output2.mov”, this reference will need to be edited to match the video file you are using. If using a different video codec it may also be necessary to amend "type="video/quicktime"" as appropriate (see point 4).
2. The php file (& any additional php files you create) need to be hosted on a machine running PHP (e.g. a web server) to perform its function. You could test and develop the function of the html, css & js files hosting these locally, but the functionality that follows pressing “Submit” on the index page will not work. See University Service Portal Knowledge article https://salfordprod.service-now.com/sp?id=search&q=KB0010645 for information on University provided hosting accounts.
3. When the php files are performing their function they e-mail test results to an address “hard written” into the code of the files. Currently placeholder address "you@edu.salford.ac.uk" is used, this will need to be edited to the test owner's e-mail address.
4. At the time at head of this information the js (JavaScript) file which switches audio tracks has limited browser support. It has been tested & works on Safari & Edge 84. It does not currently work in Chrome without specific developer flags enabled. The entire project needs to be developed further for Firefox, most recent update attempts to overcome problems with video compatibility in Firefox, if succesful then work to correctly style the test faders will be investigated.
5. Consideration should be given to GDPR regulation, despite the very small amount of data being collected (name of subject) in running the test. You might consider removing the text input field for name from the test to anonmyise it, removing personal data fom the test, but as the page wil be hosted on the net & searchable & accesible to anyone this runs the risk of random & possibly unreliable results.
